# Memories of Robert Miller

A memorial website for my Grandpa.

## Design

The site displays content from a google spreadsheet, collected by google forms. It uses Tabletop.js to interface with the google sheets api.

```
forms -> spreadsheet -> this site
```

## Deploying

It's deployed using github pages to [simple.gy/bob-miller-rocks](https://www.simple.gy/bob-miller-rocks/).
