Dad had his sense of humor right up until the end.  We told him we loved him and there was a pause due to the electronics and cell tower transmission.  Dad said, “what did you have to do...vote on it,”</p><p class="name muted" title="Shared on 7/25/2019 at 4:02:03 PM">from Shawn Miller</p></li><li id="m-1564002212000"><p class="text">I remember how much Grandpa loved his hobbies, particularly sailing and golf.  I started playing golf mostly to spend time together with the Miller men, but I still remember his lessons: The short game is more important than long drives.  A wood can often be used to “putt” onto the green en lieu of a wedge. Watch professional women play for the best example of technique.  Grandpa enjoyed sharing his knowledge about golf perhaps as much as playing it- and know that whenever I play, i’ll remember him.</p><p class="name muted" title="Shared on 7/24/2019 at 2:03:32 PM">from Scott Miller</p></li><li id="m-1563747074000"><p class="text">I remember that Scott and I always looked forward to picking a James Bond movie to watch. Grandpa had them all. An entire cabinet under the tv, full left-to-right of VHS tapes of every James Bond film ever made, perfectly aligned, with crisp cardboard sleeves in beautiful condition. Probably chronologically sorted too, though we wouldn't have recognized it at the time.</p><p class="name muted" title="Shared on 7/21/2019 at 3:11:14 PM">from Eric Miller</p></li></ul></section>
